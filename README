Implementation of Goldfarb-Idnani dual active set algorithm for quadratic
programming.


!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!This is still an alpha version!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Features
    - Double sided inequality constraints: 'lb <= A*x <= ub'. Such constraints
      can be handled in a more efficient way than 'lb <= A*x' commonly used in
      other implementations of the algorithm.
    - Simple bounds: 'lb <= x <= ub'.


Dependencies
    - cmake
    - Eigen
    - Boost (for C++ tests)


Differences from other implementations, e.g. QuadProgpp/eiQuadProg:
    - do not compute value of the objective function;
    - do not compute/update Lagrange multipliers for equality constraints;
    - double sided inequalities;
    - simple bounds;
    - lazy data initialization, e.g., perform inversion of the Cholesky factor
      only if some of the constraints are activated.
